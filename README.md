# RH: A Geometric Reduction of the Riemann Hypothesis

[![Lean CI](https://github.com/beanapologist/RH/actions/workflows/lean-ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/beanapologist/RH/actions/workflows/lean-ci.yml)

This repository contains a Lean 4 / Mathlib formalization of a geometric reduction of the Riemann Hypothesis.

The current development does not claim an unconditional machine-checked proof of RH. Instead, it formalizes the geometric, factorization, symmetry, and endpoint packaging arguments, and reduces the RH conclusion to a small set of explicit analytic boundary axioms.

## Architecture

**Primary endpoint route (window-limit frontier):**
- `conditional_RH` — Main theorem: Every nontrivial-strip zero of ζ lies on Re(s) = 1/2
- Routes through `conditional_RH_via_window_limits`, now expressed via `conditional_RH_via_torus_compatibility_frontier`
- Uses the **torus-compatibility frontier** as the canonical top-level endpoint interface whose window-limit projection closes RH
- Grounded in analytic theory: lattice-window zeros converge to strip limits, then phase-lock/rigidity closes on the critical line
- Active boundary assumption: `Step1_window_zero_limit_target_assumption`
- Derived interface: `zeta_zero_is_limit_of_window_zeros`

**Unified torus-compatibility frontier (canonical top-level endpoint interface):**
- `TorusCompatibilityFrontier := StrongDefectFrontier ∧ WindowLimitFrontier`
- Shared defect object: `torusCompatibilityDefect N s = ‖xi_partial_defect2D (prime_window N) s‖`
- Shared lock predicate: `torusPhaseLock s := Re(s) = 1/2`
- Strong-defect projection: quantitative off-critical incompatibility via eventual positive lower bounds
- Window-limit projection: strip limit-points of window zeros force torus phase lock

**Extended endpoint:**
- `rh_endpoint_master` — Same conclusion packaged with geometric/analytic bridge data
- Routes through `conditional_RH_via_window_limits_with_bridge`
- Output includes critical-line rigidity, phase-lock closure, defect bounds, and coherence norm

**Alternative strong-defect route:** 
- `conditional_RH_from_strong_defect_frontier` — Purely algebraic rigidity via defect factorization
- Valid but more abstract; use if you prefer source/medium/sink narrative
- Requires: `xi_defect_profile_nonzero_off_critical`, `xi_partial_defect2D_window_tendsto_zero`

## Geometric Bridge

The canonical source factor **B = 1 + i** connects to the unit-circle crossing locus:

- Normalized form equals `sourcePhase(π/4)` — a unit-circle phase point
- Lies on the geometric locus where **x = y** on the circle **x² + y² = 1**
- Exact two-way characterization of the locus by two phase points: `sourcePhase(π/4)` and `sourcePhase(5π/4)`
- See: `canonical_source_direction_eq_sourcePhase_pi_div_four` and `unit_circle_re_eq_im_iff_eq_sourcePhase_pi_div_four_or_five_pi_div_four`

## Status

**Formally Proved (no `sorry`):**
- Geometric framework: factorization, magnitude balance, coherence symmetry, critical-line forced σ = 1/2
- Cartesian/polar channel decomposition, prime-wise decomposition
- Finite-window refinement identities and phase-velocity relations
- Endpoint packaging and bridge data coherence
- Unit-circle crossing locus characterization

**Not Formalized (explicit boundary axioms):**
- **Window-limit frontier (active Step-1 form):** `Step1_window_zero_limit_target_assumption`
- **Strong-defect frontier:** `xi_defect_profile_nonzero_off_critical`, `xi_partial_defect2D_window_tendsto_zero`
- **Supporting boundaries:** `xi_logderiv_formula`, `xi_logderiv_symmetry_sum`, `phase_velocity_on_critical_line`, `completedHurwitzZetaEven_zero_conj_of_ne_zero`, `xi_partial_defect2D_factor_boundary`, `missingPrimeCore_cauchy_tail`, `partialEulerPhaseVelocity_window_tendsto`, `phase_lock_shift_constant_11_over_8`

See end of `RH.lean` for full inventory.

## Assumption Discharge Roadmap

To move from the current reduction to an unconditional theorem, the remaining work is to replace each boundary axiom with a proved theorem in Lean.

Current checklist status: all interfaces are theorem-clean (no `sorry`), but endpoint closure is still conditional on explicit `variable` assumptions in `RH.lean`.

Execution status notes:
- Lattice-native closure routing is in place (`F(s,t)` boundary -> window zero limit -> phase-lock bridge -> RH endpoint).
- `phase_lock_from_window_limit` is a theorem (no placeholder), but currently depends on strong-defect assumptions already declared in the file.
- `zeta_zero_is_limit_of_window_zeros` is now derived from the active Step-1 assumption.
- Step-1 landing interface is now explicit and non-alias: `Step1ApproximationFrontier := F_lattice_zero_limit_boundary`.
- `xi_logderiv_formula` and `completedHurwitzZetaEven_zero_conj_of_ne_zero` remain high-value analytic discharge targets.

Recommended order (dependency-first), now tracked as a checklist:

- [ ] `Step1_window_zero_limit_target_assumption` (prove Step-1 window-zero limit boundary)
- [ ] `xi_partial_defect2D_window_tendsto_zero` (prove defect closure to zero)
- [ ] `xi_defect_profile_nonzero_off_critical` (prove eventual off-critical lower bound)
- [ ] `missingPrimeCore_cauchy_tail` (prove missing-prime tails are Cauchy)
- [ ] `partialEulerPhaseVelocity_window_tendsto` (prove window velocity tends to ξ-core)
- [ ] `xi_logderiv_formula` (classical ξ'/ξ identity)
- [ ] `xi_logderiv_symmetry_sum` (symmetric digamma/ζ-logderivative identity)
- [ ] `phase_velocity_on_critical_line` (chain-rule/branch theorem on critical line)
- [ ] `completedHurwitzZetaEven_zero_conj_of_ne_zero` (completed Hurwitz-even conjugation)
- [x] `completedRiemannZeta_conj` (derived globally from established conjugation lemmas)
- [ ] `xi_partial_defect2D_factor_boundary` (replace factor-boundary placeholder with theorem)
- [ ] `phase_lock_shift_constant_11_over_8` (optional heuristic boundary; can be isolated from RH core)

**Milestone criterion:**
- Airtight status in this repository is reached when all active `variable` assumptions in `RH.lean` that feed endpoint closure are replaced by theorem proofs.

## Discharged Assumptions Summary

### ✓ Item 4: `completedRiemannZeta_factor_bridge_at_exceptional_lattice`
**Route:** Lattice-point factorization trivializes under π/Gamma/ζ definitions.
**Proof:** `simp [completedRiemannZeta]` — automatic by definitional unfolding.

### ✓ Item 9: `phase_lock_from_window_limit`
**Route:** Geometric incompatibility of hyperbolic and circular constraints; window zeros enforce critical line via 2D-defect route.
**Proof:** 
- `phase_lock_rigidity_strong s hstrip` forces `Re(s) = 1/2` (via 2D-defect contradiction)
- `xi_real_on_critical_line s.im` yields `ξ(1/2 + it) ∈ ℝ`
- Chain: Re(s)=1/2 → s=1/2+itt → ξ s ∈ ℝ

**Key insight:** h = e^μ, coherenceC(h) = sech(μ), sech(μ)=1 ↔ μ=0 ↔ Re(s)=1/2.

## Remaining Items: Feasibility Assessment

### Tier 1: Classical Formulas (require Mathlib drop-ins or novel proofs)
- **Item 1:** `xi_logderiv_formula` — ξ'/ξ = 1/s + 1/(s-1) - log(π)/2 + (1/2)ψ(s/2) + ζ'/ζ
  - *Status:* Requires product-rule + logarithmic-derivative calculation or Mathlib reference theorem
  - *Feasibility:* Medium — provable via Lean calculus but involves many steps
  
- **Item 2:** `xi_logderiv_symmetry_sum` — (1/2)(ψ(s/2) + ψ((1-s)/2)) = log π - (ζ'/ζ(s) + ζ'/ζ(1-s))
  - *Status:* Consequence of ξ functional equation and digamma symmetry
  - *Feasibility:* Medium — requires functional equation + Mathlib digamma lemmas

- **Item 3:** `phase_velocity_on_critical_line` — d/dt[log ξ(1/2 + it)] = i · core(t)
  - *Status:* Chain rule applied to logarithmic derivative at s = 1/2 + it
  - *Feasibility:* Medium-High — requires Lean 4 `deriv_comp` machinery and differentiability setup

### Tier 2: Functional Equation / Conjugation (deep analytic or from Mathlib)
- **Item 5:** `completedHurwitzZetaEven_zero_conj_of_ne_zero` — conj(completed-Hurwitz-even(0,s)) = completed-Hurwitz-even(0,conj(s))
  - *Status:* Functional equation symmetry at Hurwitz level
  - *Feasibility:* Low-Medium — depends on Mathlib's completed-Hurwitz-even API

### Tier 3: Euler Product Convergence (require analytic bounds or Mathlib theorems)
- **Item 6:** `xi_partial_defect2D_window_tendsto_zero` — window 2D-defect → 0 as prime window → ∞
  - *Status:* Euler product convergence (the defect is what remains after finite product)
  - *Feasibility:* Low — requires explicit Euler product asymptotics or Mathlib LSeries convergence lemmas

- **Item 7:** `xi_defect_profile_nonzero_off_critical` — defect norm stays bounded away from 0 off Re(s)=1/2
  - *Status:* Defect "rigidity" away from critical line (opposite of convergence)
  - *Feasibility:* Low — requires novel contradiction argument or Mathlib asymptotic bounds

- **Item 8:** `missingPrimeCore_cauchy_tail` — missing-primes partial cores form Cauchy sequence
  - *Status:* Standard tail convergence (if Euler product converges, tail is Cauchy)
  - *Feasibility:* Low-Medium — requires explicit convergence rates or Mathlib Filter.Tendsto machinery

- **Item 10:** `partialEulerPhaseVelocity_window_tendsto` — windowed Euler velocity → ξ-core
  - *Status:* Window-to-full limit for phase velocity
  - *Feasibility:* Low-Medium — needs explicit window convergence, mirrors Item 6

- **Item 11:** `zeta_zero_is_limit_of_window_zeros` — ζ zeros are limits of finite-window zeros
  - *Status:* Analytic denseness via Hurwitz/Rouché or potential-theoretic argument
  - *Feasibility:* Low — deep analytic theorem, likely requires the finalized LSeries machinery in Mathlib

---

## Recommended Next Steps

**High-effort, high-impact:**
- **Items 1–3:** Pursue Mathlib exploration for `deriv_log`, digamma symmetry (`Real.digamma_add`?), and reference ξ'/ξ formulas
- **Item 5:** Check if `Complex.Gamma_conj` + `hurwitzZetaEven` definitional properties suffice

**Medium-effort, medium-impact:**
- **Items 6, 8, 10:** Attempt explicit epsilontic proofs using `Filter.Tendsto` if time permits

**Lower priority (require significant novel mathematics):**
- **Item 7:** Strip rigidity proof-by-contradiction (may require item 6 first)
- **Item 11:** Analytic denseness (requires deep LSeries theory or Rouché-theorem machinery)

**Practical strategy:**
- Keep each discharged axiom as a theorem with the same name/signature first.
- Only after theorem replacement, simplify interfaces (`WindowLimitFrontier`, `StrongDefectFrontier`) to remove now-redundant assumption wrappers.
